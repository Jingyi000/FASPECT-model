# FASPECT-model
FASPECT model is proposed to explicitly account for the inhomogeneity in the leaf structure and simulate the corresponding differences in leaf optical properties between faces.
Description of FASPECT model is found in : Jiang J, Comar A, Weiss M, et al. FASPECT: A model of leaf optical properties accounting for the differences between upper and lower faces. Remote Sensing of Environment, 2021, 253: 112205. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.112205
